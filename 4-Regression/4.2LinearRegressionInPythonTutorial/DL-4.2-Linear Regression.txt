LINEAR REGRESSION

Questions to ask.
1. Is the price of a car related to engine horse power OR is the target variable related to the chosen independent variable ? 
2. If yes, how strong is the relationship ?
3. Is the relationship linear ? 
4. Can we estimate the target variable from the chosen independent variable ? 

To answer first two, we need to carry out the Pearsons correlation coefficient
Ranges from -1 to 1
	-1 = Perfect inverse relation (descending)
	 0 = No relation whatsoever 
	 1 = Perfect Linear Relation (ascending)

from scipy.stats.stats import pearsonr
pearsonr(data['horsepower'], data['price']) # pearsonr(independent_var, dependent_var)

RSS - Residual sum of squares - The residual values squared and summed together.
TSS - Total sum of squares - Difference between the mean value and the actual values, squared then summed.
R²  -
- coefficient of determination
- A measure of how close the data are to the fitted  regression linear
- computed by 1- (RSS/TSS)
- Ratio of variation explained  bhy the model verses the actual variation in the sample data
- Always between 0 and 1
- 0 means the model explains none of the variation of the data from its mean
- 1 means the model explains all the variation
- Higher the R² better the model fits the data
